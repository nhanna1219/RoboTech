## About The Project

In this work, I have shared the code in which I Detected COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using PyTorch. I hope it is helpful for you guys interested in applied AI in the Medical Sector.

I will use a ResNet-18 model and train it on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. Our objective in this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy. 

**Note:** this dataset, and the model that we train in the project, can not be used to diagnose COVID-19 or Viral Pneumonia. We are only using this data for educational purpose.
##  Dataset
Dataset from [COVID-19 Radiography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) on Kaggle

Image classification of Chest X Rays in one of three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19

This COVID-19, normal, and other lung infection dataset is released in stages. In the first release, we have released 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal, and 1345 viral pneumonia chest X-ray (CXR) images. In the first update, we have increased the COVID-19 class to 1200 CXR images. In the 2nd update, we have increased the database to 3616 COVID-19 positive cases along with 10,192 Normal, 6012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection), and 1345 Viral Pneumonia images and corresponding lung masks. We will continue to update this database as soon as we have new x-ray images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
## Objectives
1. Create custom Dataset and DataLoader in PyTorch

2. Train a ResNet-18 model in PyTorch to perform Image Classification

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
   https://github.com/nqkhanh2002/Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray-using-PyTorch
   ```
2. Run the jupyter notebook 
    Notebook will automatically download data to your device. During notebook execution, use [the package installer for Python](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install packages that you are missing.
